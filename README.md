1. Problems with tutoring notes often involve formatting.
..* Sometimes the title of the file is incorrect, sometimes the blue header at the top is incorrect, sometimes tutors don't put AM/PM so I can't tell if it was from 8am-10am or 8pm-10pm.
..* Forget to change the name of the student or they'll leave in a page for another client accidentally.
2. Edits to check for misspellings, incorrect grammar, informal language, too much negativity (so tone I guess), etc.
3. Tutors who copy/paste one session's notes into another so they don't have to write up a separate page for that day. 
..* Also, sometimes too little is written - it's best to have a three to four sentence requirement for each section. 
4. It would be great if there could be some sort of dropdown box that shows a list of clients with the approved rate beside it.
..* Sometimes when tutors submit payroll they'll manually put in the wrong rate, so it would be good if admin puts in the rate FOR them, then they just choose the client. 
..* Feature where the rate is automatically increased by $5 after three months retention of client, that would be good to help tutors keep track. Sometimes they forget and I simply have too many things on my plate to catch it each time.
5. Populate to a payroll spreadsheet to reduce mistakes and then as an admin, I could sign in and check payroll that way. It would save the tutors the time of separately inputting their payments as well if they're using an easy dropdown feature from the tutoring notes page.
